# uavrt_mavlink_encoder_decoder

This ROS 2 Node is responsible for encoding and decoding MAVLink messages that are passed through the [PX4 autopilot](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/flight_controller/pixhawk4.html). These messages are sent to and from the ground control station (GCS) running a custom version of Q Ground Control (QGC).
